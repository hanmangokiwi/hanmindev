Habits are hard to break. As high-school students (at the time) studying for exams, we noticed we were often distracted by our phones, which greatly reduced our productivity. A study from Duke University found that up to 45% of all our daily actions are performed habitually, which is a huge problem especially during a time when many of us are confined to our homes, negatively impacting our productivity, as well as mental and physical health.

To fix this issue, we created HabiFix. We took the advice from a Harvard research paper to create a program that would not only help break unhealthy habits, but form healthy ones in place as well.

Unlike many other products which have to be installed by professionals, highly specialized for one single habit, or just expensive, HabiFix only requires a computer with a webcam, and can help you fix a multitude of different habits. And the usage is very simple too, just launch HabiFix on your computer, and that’s it! HabiFix will run in the background, and as soon as you perform an undesirable habit, it will remind you. According to Harvard Health Publishing, the most important thing in habit fixing is a reminder, since people often perform habits without realizing it. So when you’re studying for tomorrow’s test and pick up your phone, your computer will gently remind you to get off your phone, so you can ace that test.

Every action you do is uploaded to our server, which users can see statistics of by logging in. Another important aspect of Habit Fixing that Harvard found is reward, which we believe we can provide users by showing them their growth over time. On the website, users are able to view how many times they had to be reminded, and by showing them how they have been requiring fewer reminders throughout the week, they’ll be able to know they have been fixing their habits.
