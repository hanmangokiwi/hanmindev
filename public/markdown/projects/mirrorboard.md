Mirrorboard is a superset layout to the standard QWERTY keyboard layout which allows you to type with only one hand.

In essence, it turns the Caps Lock key into a mirror button, which mirrors the keyboard. So for example, if you press the Caps Lock key then type "qwerty", you will get out "poiuyt".

# Functions and Limitations

Mirrorboard was designed with the following goals in mind:

* Be as similar to QWERTY as possible to reduce the learning curve
* Be a superset of QWERTY to allow for easy switching between the two layouts
* Be usable with one hand, either left or right
* Require minimum hand movement from keyboard to mouse
* Allow easy access of all keys on the keyboard with one hand

Additionally, mirrorboard comes with extra functions:

* Difficult to reach keys can be accessed while using mirrorboard if using two hands
* Mouse control
* Access to keys not available on certain keyboards (e.g. arrow keys, home/end, page up/down, etc.) 

There are a number of reasons why you should use mirrorboard:

* It is very useful: It is difficult to express how useful it is because it's not something you ever think about, but I personally can say that I cannot live without it
* Efficiency: Depending on the use case, you can save a lot of time by not having to move your hands between your keyboard and mouse
* Convenience: With the addition of "programmer features", keys that are in awkward positions that require you to break your hand formation becomes much easier to access
* Utility: Ever needed to type something but didn't have a place to put your laptop down? Need to copy down text from sometime you need to hold up? Calling on your phone while typing? Mirrorboard will change the way you use your computer
* It's a fun conversation starter

However there are some limitations:

* The Caps Lock key is used as a mirror button, so it cannot be used for its original purpose
* There isn't a good key on the right side of the keyboard to use as a mirror button, so those wanting to type with their right hand will have to use the Tray button, then use '' as their modifier key. This is not ideal, but it is the best solution I could come up with. 
* There is a learning curve, although it is much smaller than other one-handed layouts
* Because the Caps Lock key must be pressed during typing frequently, typing with mirrorboard is slightly less efficient than other one-handed layouts without modifier keys.
* Because the Caps Lock key must be pressed frequently with your pinky, which is not a strong finger, there may be risks of RSI.

# Uses

Mirrorboard is insanely useful and I personally use it every day.

Here is a list of some of the things I have used it for:

* Typing single words or short phrases while doing something else (I shouldn't have to put down whatever I'm doing to type a 5-word message)
* Typing a link into a browser
* Typing with one hand while eating (prevents touching the keyboard with your greasy fingers)
* Typing with one hand while using the mouse (numerous, small corrections on a document can be made much quickly if one hand stays on the mouse)
* Holding my laptop with one hand while typing with the other [like this but unironically](https://www.dreamstime.com/young-man-laptop-white-background-image153306931)
* Typing notes on a computer with my left hand, while annotating them on a tablet with my right hand (my handwriting is atrocious, but I often need to draw diagrams or write equations)

# Real-Life usage

Although I had mirrorboard installed on my computer for longer, I only started to learn to use it properly on March 1, 2021. On that day, I covered the right side of my keyboard to force myself to use mirrorboard.

Here is a list of my WPM progress:

* March 1: 20 WPM

* March 31: 40 WPM

* April 3: 47 WPM

* June 8: 50 WPM

* August 7: 51 WPM

* September 18: 56 WPM

* September 20: 58 WPM

* September 29: 64 WPM

As of typing this message, it is 2023, and I am at around 70 WPM. I use mirrorboard extensively, but I feel like I have reached a plateau. To be fair, I can only type at 130 WPM with both hands, so the fact that I can type over half that speed with one hand is pretty good. It gets better if you consider the fact that while using mirrorboard, you have to press the Caps Lock key often, which means that in reality, you are pressing more keys than you would be if you were using two hands at half the speed.

# Motivation

I've been a fan of alternative keyboard layouts for a while. During high school I picked up Dvorak, attaining 80WPM. For reference, my QWERTY WPM was around 100 at that time.

However, Dvorak, and many other keyboard layouts, have a huge issue which is that because they are so different from the standard QWERTY layout, it is easy to forget how to use the other layout.

I experienced this first-hand when I had to use the library computer to print off a paper. Having not used a QWERTY keyboard in several months, I stood there for a good 5 minutes trying to log into my Google account, typing slower than my tech illiterate grandmother.

This became a common trend whenever I had to use a computer that didn't belong to me. To make matters worse, alternative keyboard layouts like Dvorak have poor support in many applications, which meant that I had to rebind my keys for almost every single application I used.

This was frustrating, and I eventually gave up on Dvorak.

It was around this time I became interested in one-handed keyboard layouts. Sure, there were layouts like left-handed Dvorak, but I wanted it to be as similar to QWERTY as possible, for app compatibility and muscle memory reasons.

An idea I had for a while was to make a one-handed keyboard layout which was a superset of QWERTY. By mirroring the keyboard with a modifier key, you could somewhat easily map your right-hand muscle memory to your left, which meant you wouldn't forget how to use a QWERTY keyboard.

Since during normal operation the layout is the same as QWERTY, there wouldn't be any compatibility issues, meaning I didn't have to rebind my keys for every single application I used.

Of course, all original ideas have already been taken. So I stole the name from this [xkcd blog](https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/) by Randall.
