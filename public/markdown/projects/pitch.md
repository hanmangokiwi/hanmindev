There are millions of people around the world who have certain mental and physical conditions which makes creating visual presentations extremely difficult.

For these people, being unable to create presentations isn’t just a hassle. It’s a barrier to learning in schools, and a career disadvantage in the workplace. That’s why we created Pitch.ai.

Pitch.ai is a web app which creates visual presentations for you as you present. Once you open the web app, just start talking! Pitch.ai will listen to what you say and in real-time and generate a slide deck based on the content of your speech, just as if you had a slideshow prepared in advance.
